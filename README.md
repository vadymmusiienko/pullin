## Project Description

**Pull-In: Find a Fourth** is a full-stack web application built to simplify and humanize the roommate and suitemate matching process. It connects students who are looking to be “pulled in” — often due to later registration times or a desire to meet new people — with groups who are looking to fill a room slot.

By streamlining this process, Pull-In promotes meaningful connections, reduces stress, and helps build stronger, more comfortable campus living communities.

## Motivation

Finding compatible roommates can be stressful, especially for those unsure where to start or how to connect. We wanted to build a platform that makes the process easier, more efficient, and more equitable for everyone involved.

**Why this matters:**
- Reduces anxiety and uncertainty around housing
- Helps students make informed and confident decisions
- Fosters a more connected and supportive student community

- **Framework:** Next.js (frontend + backend)
- **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication
- **Database:** Firebase Cloud Firestore
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Architecture:** Server actions, server components, and client-side rendering
- **Libraries:** Modern UI libraries and lightweight backend utilities

## Privacy & Security

Pull-In is built with **user safety and privacy** in mind:
- Only collects necessary information
- Utilizes secure authentication via Firebase
- Promotes respectful and transparent communication

## How It Works

1. **Sign Up:**  
   Create an account and specify your housing registration time.

2. **Browse Groups:**  
   View groups that are looking to pull someone in.

3. **Connect:**  
   If you find a good match:
   - Send a request to join the group  
   - Or reach out via the group member's email (provided in profiles) for more info

4. **Create Your Own Group:**  
   - Form a group with friends  
   - Browse individuals looking to join a group  
   - Send invitations or accept join requests

## Future Vision

We plan to expand Pull-In with:
- Enhanced filters and preferences
- Group messaging and coordination tools
- Support for other campuses and communities

Our ultimate goal is to build a more connected, less stressful housing experience for all students.
